# Project Planner

Project planner - is Flutter application which let users create and manage projects. This app comes with local and cloud storage features. For the local storage it uses Hive-NoSQL and for cloud it uses the MangoDB Atlas. 



Since it is a multi user app , other can change projects and sync the data back MongoDB (cloud) .It also allows to download the data separately  using `Backup from cloud` and a ready to use offline [`Import from backup`] . 

## IDE and Tools used

Mostly I prefer `Visaul Studio Code` while I working with this Project, later  I found that Android Studio is superior in features, it offer better Flutter method listing and documentation.  I also used `Mongo Compass` to check the only changes of my collection (data).
